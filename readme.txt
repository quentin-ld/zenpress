However, I am accepting donations on my buymeacoffee page : https://buymeacoffee.com/quentinld. If you work at an agency that develops with WordPress, ask your company to provide sponsorship in order to invest in its supply chain. The tools that I maintain probably save your company time and money, and Buy me a coffee support can now be done at the organisation level.
