# Zenpress Plugin

ZenPress is a lightweight WordPress and WooCommerce plugin focused on performance, security, and minimalism.
This document describes the development workflow to keep code quality, consistency, and easy deployment.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- PHP **7.4 or higher** (tested up to PHP 8.4)
- Composer
- Node.js & npm (for WordPress Scripts)
- WordPress >= **6.0**

### Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
composer install
npm install
```

## üßπ Code Quality

ZenPress enforces strict coding standards and static analysis to avoid bugs and maintain clean code.

### PHP Linting

Run PHP linting with:
```bash
composer run lint:php
```

This will:

- Use **PHP CS Fixer** to automatically fix code style issues.

- Use **PHPStan** for static analysis and bug detection.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

- Each snippet is stored in `/inc/` with its own `.php` file.
- Metadata for snippets is stored in `/inc/meta/` for scalability and translations.
- Follow the **ZenPress coding conventions**:
  - Use `exit;` instead of `die();`
  - Prefix all functions with `zenpress_`
  - Add **DocBlocks** with `@since` and `@return`
- All new code must pass linting.

### ‚úÖ Example DocBlock format

```php
<?php
/**
 * Title: Disable DNS prefetch
 * Category: Performance
 * Description: Removes DNS prefetch resource hints from the wp_head, reducing unnecessary DNS lookups.
 *
 * @return void
 * @since 1.0.0
 */
